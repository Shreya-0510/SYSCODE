# PowerGrid – AI-Powered Project Intelligence System

Predictive analytics platform to forecast **cost overruns** and **delays** for PGCIL power transmission projects.

## Highlights
- Built **interactive dashboards** for scheduling, geospatial hotspot mapping, and risk visualization.  
- Implemented **ML models** (XGBoost, Random Forest, CatBoost) to predict cost overruns and delays.  
- Handled **data ingestion, cleaning, and feature engineering** using Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.  

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React  
- **Backend:** Flask  
- **ML & Data Processing:** Python (XGBoost, Random Forest, CatBoost, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- **Visualization:** Mapbox, Leaflet   

## Project Idea
The Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) executes hundreds of capital-intensive power transmission projects annually. These projects often face **delays and cost escalations** due to vendor inefficiency, regulatory bottlenecks, terrain challenges, and material shortages. Current monitoring tools are mostly reactive.  

**PowerGrid/APIS** is designed to provide **predictive insights**, helping project managers identify risks, forecast delays, and optimize schedules using historical and real-time data. It combines **machine learning**, **data visualization**, and a modular **full-stack web platform** to improve transparency, accountability, and project efficiency.
